# Min-Knapsack Problem with Compactness Constraints

This is a collection of algorithms to solve:

* The min-Knapsack Problem with Compactness Constraints (mKPC), a generalisation of the classical min-Knapsack problem. The mKPC arises as a sub-problem in some algorithms for change-point detection in time series analysis (such as the [PRISCA](https://github.com/lorenzocapp/prisca) algorithm) and for variable selection in genetic fine-mapping (such as the [SuSiE](https://stephenslab.github.io/susieR/) algorithm).
* The unit-cost mKPC, which is a polynomially-solvable special case of the mKPC.

This software was developped as part of the following manuscript:

> TODO: add a reference to the pre-print, once it is on-line.

## Data

* Data in `data/cappello-raw-data` is raw csv data received from Cappello and Madrid Padilla.
* Data in `data/cappello-instances` is json data created starting from the above csv data, using `data/cappello_transform_raw_data.py`.
* Data in `data/synthetic-instances` is data generated by us using `data/generator.py`.
