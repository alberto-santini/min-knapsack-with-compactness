# Min-Knapsack Problem with Compactness Constraints

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.7492799.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7492799)

This is a collection of algorithms to solve:

* The min-Knapsack Problem with Compactness Constraints (mKPC), a generalisation of the classical min-Knapsack problem. The mKPC arises as a sub-problem in some algorithms for change-point detection in time series analysis (such as the [PRISCA](https://github.com/lorenzocapp/prisca) algorithm) and for variable selection in genetic fine-mapping (such as the [SuSiE](https://stephenslab.github.io/susieR/) algorithm).
* The unit-cost mKPC, a polynomially-solvable particular case of the mKPC.

This software was developed as part of the following manuscript:
